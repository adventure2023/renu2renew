        <h1>Why did I choose to run for Newark City Council</h1>
        <p> <i>
Serving the community has always been my greatest inspiration. Through my involvement in local education, cultural immersion and youth programs, I’ve seen how meaningful change happens when people come together for the common good.

<br> <br>I hold a Bachelor’s in Computer Science and an MBA from UC Berkeley. Over the years, I’ve built a career as a technologist and entrepreneur, focusing on solving complex problems, leading large teams, and driving innovation to improve operational efficiency. While my professional accomplishments have been significant, my most fulfilling work has always involved giving back to my communities. The same principles of collaboration, strategic planning, and innovation that have shaped my career are needed to address Newark’s urgent issues: public safety, homelessness, and affordable housing.

<br> <br>These issues are personal to me. Watching local businesses suffer from break-ins and seeing more homelessness in our city has made it clear we need thoughtful, compassionate solutions. These challenges inspire me to step forward and work toward building a safer, more supportive Newark for everyone.

<br> <br>As a mother, I’ve been actively involved in youth development and education. I lead a Girl Scouts troop and coach robotics teams, empowering young minds to explore their potential. I’ve also worked with schools to bring educational programs like MOEMS and MathCounts to our children, ensuring they have access to valuable learning opportunities. These experiences have reinforced the importance of listening to the community and collaborating to solve problems.

<br> <br>When in office, my top priority will be improving public safety. I am committed to using data-driven approaches to ensure law enforcement is responsive and well-connected to the community, protecting both businesses and residents. I will also address affordable housing by fostering public-private partnerships that provide immediate relief and long-term stability for those in need. Newark must remain a place where all residents can live with dignity and security.

<br> <br>Improving infrastructure is critical to Newark’s future. From maintaining roads and streetlights to enhancing parks and recreational spaces, we need to invest in public spaces to improve residents’ quality of life and enable better operations for businesses. Drawing from my experience managing large-scale projects, I will ensure these initiatives are completed efficiently, transparently, and within budget.

<br> <br>I’m not running for city council because I have all the answers. I’m running because I care deeply about Newark and want to be part of the solution. My candidacy is rooted in my love for this community, my professional experience, and my belief that together, we can create positive change. I am humbled by the opportunity to serve Newark—a city I’ve called home for 20 yrs—and I look forward to working alongside residents to make it a better place for everyone.

<br> <br>I envision renewing Newark!
